## 📘 Overview

This mini-project is to demonstrate how the backtracking algorithm can be used to solve a problem like Sudoku.

The process of trying possible candidates to the solution and backtracking as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution, is visible via the animation of solving.

Backtracking is much faster than brute-force enumeration of all complete candidates.
